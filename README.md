# Healthcare App

## Overview

This app allows the exchange of healthcare information between patients and doctors.  There are 3 roles in the application: doctors, patients and health agency.  

## Getting started

The database will initially be empty. To get some data to work with, patients, doctors and medications need to be added.  

### Adding patients
- If not yet in registration mode: use the toggle button labeled "Create account" to switch to registration mode.
- Use the dropdown to select the "Patient" option.
- Fill in the fields to add patient and address data. Only the "Appartment" field is optional, the rest is required.
- Click the "Create account" button.

### Adding doctors
- If not yet in registration mode: use the toggle button labeled "Create account" to switch to registration mode.
- Use the dropdown to select the "Doctor" option.
- Fill in the fields to add doctor data. 
- Click the "Create account" button.

### Adding medications
- If not yet in login mode: use the toggle button labeled "Switch to login" to switch to login mode.
- Use the dropdown to select the "Health Agency" option.
- Click the "Login" button.
- Fill in the fields to add medication data.
- Click the "Add medication" button.

## Using the application

Once a few patients, doctors and medications have been added, you can start using the application.  
I suggest to start using the application as a doctor first, as doctors can add prescription entities.

Here are the steps to login as a patient or doctor:

- If not yet in login mode: use the toggle button labeled "Switch to login" to switch to login mode.
- Select patient or doctor from the dropdown.
- Fill in the first and lastname matching one of the patients/doctors created earlier. Partial matches are OK.
- Click the login button
